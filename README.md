## Introduction

Welcome to my repository of "deprecated" X11 dotfiles. This collection includes configurations for Window managers I no longer use. If you haven't already, I highly recommend visiting my primary [dotfiles](https://github.com/speyll/dotfiles) repository for the most up-to-date configurations.

This repository serves as a historical archive of my older X11 dotfiles, since i moved to Wayland now, While these configurations may not be in active use, they are still usable. If you intend to use any of these, I recommend to combine them with the updated shell configurations and scripts available in my primary dotfiles repository.
